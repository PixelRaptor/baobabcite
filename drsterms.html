We will not be liable if for any reason the Site is unavailable at any time or for any period. If you choose, or you are provided with a user identification code, password or other piece of information as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential, and you must not disclose it to any third party. We have the right to disable any user identification code or password, whether chosen by you or allocated by us, at any time, if in our opinion you have failed to comply with any provisions of these Terms of Use. You are also responsible for ensuring that all persons who access our Site through your internet connection are aware of these Terms of Use, and that they comply with them.</p><h2>Reliance on information published</h2><p>The information and other materials posted on or contained within the Site is provided for general information and education purpose and is in no way intended to serve as a substitute for medical advice, or to amount to advice on which reliance should be placed. If you have a medical condition, you should promptly see a medical professional or health care provider. This diabetes risk assessment questionnaire is not intended to offer medical diagnosis or patient specific treatment advice. We therefore disclaim all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such materials by any visitor to our Site, or by anyone who may be informed of any of their content.</p><h2>You</h2><p>We mentioned above the minimum information that you’ll have to provide us for your registration to be effective. Of course, that information alone will be enough to identify you personally and so for that reason, it is protected under the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) (GDPR). You may want to supplement your profile with further information about yourself and the information you post to our social media platforms may reveal more about yourself. We will handle that information in accordance with our <a href="http://www.baobabcircle.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Notice</a>, which forms part of these Terms and thereby, our contract with you. We must be able to identify you as an individual from the information contained within your profile and therefore, you confirm that your profile information is accurate and that you will keep it up to date. Please bear in mind that to make use of our Services, you will provide us with information concerning medical conditions from which you – or those for whom you are responsible – suffer. To deliver the Service to you, we will need to manage and process that information. For the purpose of the GDPR (the law that governs how information about individuals can be used by organisations such as us in Europe) we need your explicit consent to do this, so we need you to give us that permission by checking the relevant boxes when completing the registration process.</p><p>Because of the way English law works, children are not capable of entering into contracts. Therefore, generally our users must be at least 18 years of age and you confirm that you are and that you are capable of entering into binding contracts. If you are not yet 18 years of age but are 13 years of age or older, you may have a parent or guardian accept these terms on your behalf. To do this, we will need the name of the parent or guardian in question, their relationship to you and their phone number, so that we can send them a link to complete this registration on your behalf. You will not be able to use our Services until your parent or guardian has completed your registration.</p><p>In addition, only individuals that are resident in Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Uganda, Mauritius and The Seychelles are permitted to register as users. To establish your right to use our Services, you must confirm where you live by providing us with your postal address. If necessary, we may also store your IP address to confirm your location (see our Privacy Notice for more information on this).</p><p>Assuming then that you are over 18 (or that you are a parent or guardian of a child of 13 years of age or more), that you are capable of entering into contracts that are legally binding upon you and that you are resident in Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Uganda, Mauritius and The Seychelles ,your registration on these Terms gives rise to a contract between you and us that is indeed binding on both you and us and those that may later inherit the benefit of the contracts that we have formed. You may not transfer or sell your rights under this contract to anybody else nor may you use it as security for anything. In running our Services, we may, for some reason have to ‘assign’ the contract that we’ve formed with you to another business (for example, as part of a restructure or if we are acquired by another company).</p><p>You can terminate your registration at any time. There is more about this in the Privacy Notice and our FAQs so please follow the instructions provided there. We may terminate your account if, at our discretion we consider it to have become inactive. Generally, this will be where you have not made use of our Services for a year or so, but it may be less and there may be other factors we take into account.</p><h2>Fees</h2><p>You will pay for our products and services in advance when registering or, having registered, at some later date when you decide that you would like to make use of one of our products and/or services for which we charge. Payment will be made via a mobile payments gateway or by credit/debit card as applicable. Only when we have received your payment will you be able to obtain unrestricted access to the product or service in question. Please also bear in mind that if that payment is reversed for any reason that isn’t our fault, we may suspend your access to that product or service and we may even terminate your registration if, in our reasonable opinion, we feel that to be justified. Unless otherwise stated, all fees and charges stated in respect of the products and services we offer include all applicable taxes, levies, or other governmental charges imposed. You are responsible for all such taxes, levies and charges chargeable as a result of the purchase or use of our products or services, though we will take care of any taxes, levies or charges that are included in the purchase price we charge.</p><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>We always keep an eye on how well the functionality we’ve provided is working. We’re working on new features all the time and occasionally, we may want to replace older features with new, better ones. We reserve the right under these Terms to add or remove functionality and features. We will do our best to give you some advance notice of this but from time to time, this might not be possible. For example, if something breaks and it is complicated to fix and not sufficiently popular to warrant dropping everything to fix, we may decide to withdraw it immediately. That withdrawal may be temporary or it may be that we withdraw it permanently, and we have the right to decide what’s best in the circumstances.</p><p>It might be that new functionality requires changes or additions to these Terms, the Baobab Circle Community Rules (if we introduce them) or the Privacy Notice, so when we launch new features, you might want to check to see whether we’ve made any changes to any of these.</p><p>Consumers enjoy protection under a variety of laws in different jurisdictions around the world and, if you’re not a health professional, it’s likely that you are using the Service as a consumer. Nothing in these Terms is intended to undermine your protection either in England or wherever you happen to be when you access the Service.</p><p>In English law, it would be unlawful for us to attempt to exclude or limit liability for personal injury or death arising from our negligence or for any loss you suffer as a result of our fraud or for any statement we make fraudulently intending you to rely on it in entering into this contract with us, so nothing in these Registration Terms should be interpreted as if it is intended to limit or exclude any of this sort of harm, loss or damage. However, please bear in mind that it’s essential for you to continue to consult with professional healthcare providers about the management of your condition. Our Services are not a substitute for professional healthcare advice and support. We will do our best to help you manage your condition by continually reviewing and updating the performance of our algorithms but sadly we can’t guarantee that even if you do remain fully engaged with our services, your condition will improve and in fact, it’s possible that it may worsen. You can read more about the limitations of our products and services in the management of specific conditions here. Bearing in mind always the exceptions we have mentioned in the previous paragraph, there are certain types of liability that we are permitted by law to limit or exclude and, accordingly, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS, DAMAGE OR EXPENSE (INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, BUSINESS OR GOODWILL)THAT YOU MIGHT SUFFER AS A RESULT OF USING THE SERVICE, HOWEVER THAT LOSS DAMAGE OR EXPENSE MIGHT ARISE. In addition, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE OR RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY FAILURE TO PERFORM OR FOR THE DELAY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY OF OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE TERMS THAT IS CAUSED BY EVENTS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL. This might include a failure of an internet service provider to deliver notifications or emails to you, for instance, or the absence of mobile telecommunications signal that means content is not delivered to your device promptly.</p><p>If we happen to make a statement that turns out to be untrue (whether orally or in writing) prior to your registration, then, unless that statement was made fraudulently by us, we will only be liable to you should that untrue statement result in us breaching these Terms. If it does not, the untrue statement has no impact on our relationship with you save insofar as it may impact on your legal rights as a consumer.</p><p>Finally, please note that we rely on our users to post content to our social media accounts in good faith. We do not check or endorse any of the posts so you should always satisfy yourself that they are reliable and carry out your own checks. If you consider a post made by a user to be unreasonable, misleading or unfair, please feel free to contact us at admin@BaobabCircle.com, explaining where you found that content and why you feel it should be removed. These limitations and exclusions of liability will survive the termination of your registration (which, in turn, would terminate our contract with you). In making sure that our users are satisfied and that the Service is working efficiently, we may review the data being transmitted by you by or any of our other users. This does NOT mean, however, that we are under any duty to do this and we do not and will not assume any responsibility for this. Nevertheless, as we have indicated above, we may take steps to have content posted by you or by other users to our social media accounts removed if that content contravenes these Terms or the user posting that content is in breach of these Terms. Likewise, if you see content on those accounts that offends you, please do let us know and we will look into it.</p><p>You also need to be aware that viruses can be transmitted via websites and even mobile applications, not just email. So if you want to make sure that your systems are safe from infection, you should run suitable security software because WE HEREBY EXCLUDE LIABILITY FOR ANY VIRUS INFECTION OR OTHER HARM CAUSED TO YOUR SYSTEMS THROUGH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE OR WHEN FOLLOWING ANY LINKS TO WEBSITES OR MOBILE APPLICATIONS RUN BY OTHER PEOPLE.</p><p>There may come occasions where we choose not to insist on your total compliance with your obligations under these Terms or that, where you’ve breached the Terms, that we don’t make use of our rights to take action against you. This does NOT mean, however, that we are waiving those rights. We can take action against you later if we so choose, and at any time during the lifetime of your registration (or indeed, where necessary, at any time after the termination of your registration), we can return to the issue and insist upon your compliance.</p><h2>Intellectual Property Rights</h2><p>Intellectual property is the term used to describe things that can be owned but which are not physical in nature. The owner of intellectual property doesn’t own something that is tangible but instead has the right to control how that intangible thing is used, hence the term “intellectual property rights”. Trade marks, patents and copyright are well-known and commonplace forms of intellectual property, but there are lots more besides. If you use somebody else’s intellectual property rights without their permission (which is often referred to as a “licence”), you’ve “infringed” their rights.</p><p>When you post content of whatever nature to the Service or our social media accounts, you confirm that either you own the intellectual property rights in that content or, if those rights belong to someone else, that you have their permission to post it. You also confirm that you will not post content that infringes the rights of others, whether users of the Service or not. When posting content to the Service, where applicable you give us permission to reuse that content on a non-exclusive basis for the purpose of providing the Service to our users wherever they may be in the world. That licence will enable us without charge to store, use, perform, display, reproduce, modify, distribute or sub-licence that content, as the case may be. Where the intellectual property rights in the content that you have uploaded belongs to somebody else, you confirm that the owner gave you their permission to grant us the same licence to reuse that content as if it was you that owned it. The content you post may be viewable by other people. You acknowledge that the content you post (and in posting, licence to us) contributes to the revenue we generate from the operation of our Services.</p><p>You may revoke the licence you have given us at any time by deleting the content in question or by terminating your registration. Where you do either of those things, content that you have uploaded to the Service will be removed from our live service as soon as possible and from our back-ups over a reasonable time. Content that you have uploaded to associated social media accounts may be removed in accordance with the content policies of the social media provider in question. There’s more on this in our Privacy Notice.</p><p>Where you post content that infringes the intellectual property rights of somebody else or is unlawful for some other reason, we may delete that content immediately should we be contacted by somebody complaining about it. We will contact you to let you know that we’ve done this (unless we are required not to by law) and you can contact us to explain what’s happened or, perhaps, complain about what’s happened (if you believe you had the right to use that content or that you believe you actually own it).</p><p>If you breach the terms relating to your content either by posting Unlawful Content or by posting content that infringes the intellectual property rights of others, there is a good chance that we are going to have to devote resources to dealing with the problem. This may involve spending real cash money on lawyers, investigators and the like. Consequently, where this happens you agree to fully compensate us, pound for pound, on demand for any and all such losses, whether in the form of direct expenses or for our loss of time or for other things that are readily quantifiable. In legalese, you ‘indemnify us’ and ‘will hold us harmless’. Where we suffer other losses that are harder to quantify, we reserve the right to pursue you for the recovery of these. Our right to take action to recover such losses or to insist on this indemnity will survive the termination of your registration (which would otherwise terminate our contract with you). One final thing on the subject of intellectual property rights. Just as you may own the content that you post to the Service, so we own the framework and content that makes up the Service. That includes all the ‘copy’, the code, the look and feel and the trade marks and graphics and you can use all of that in making use of your registration in accordance with these Terms but absolutely no more than that. Please don’t try to use any of the intellectual property that we provide for purposes that are not intended or envisaged by these Terms. If you come across any evidence to suggest that anybody else is using the Service in breach of these Terms, please let us know so that we can take action to stop them.</p></div></div></section><section class="bg-blue forms" id="contact"><div class="container"><div class="form"><h2>Get in touch</h2><p>If you have any questions regarding Baobab Circle or Afya Pap please feel free to get in touch.</p><a href="mailto:info@baobabcircle.com" class="button simple-btn">Info@baobabcircle.com</a></div></div></section><section class="bg-darkblue social"><div class="container"><h3>Follow Baobab Circle</h3><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/BaobabCircle?lang=en-gb" target="_blank" class="twitter">twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/afyapap/" target="_blank" class="instagram">instagram</a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/AfyaPap/" target="_blank" class="facebook">facebook</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/10640353?trk=tyah&trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Acompany%2CclickedEntityId%3A10640353%2Cidx%3A2-1-2%2CtarId%3A1475575978002%2Ctas%3Abaobab%20circle" target="_blank" class="linkedin">linkedin</a></li></ul></div></section><footer class="bg-gray"><div class="container"><a href="index.html"><img src="../images/footer_logo.svg" width="149" height="27" alt="baobab logo" class="footer-logo-img"></a><ul><li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li><li><a href="privacy.html">Privacy</a></li><li><a href="terms.html">Terms &amp; Conditions</a></li></ul><a href="terms.html" class="copy">All rights reserved. &copy; Baobab 2018</a></div></footer><div id="overlay"></div><div id="phonePopup"><h2>Let's get started</h2><p>Please insert your Kenyan mobile number, you will recieve a<br>SMS to your phone which will allow you to begin<br>using Baobab circle.</p><div class="form"><form action="sendmail.php" method="post" id="contact-sms-form" accept-charset="utf-8"><input type="text" name="phonePrefix" class="phonePrefix" value="(+254)" disabled="disabled"> <input type="tel" name="phone" id="phone" placeholder="712345678" value="712345678" required maxlength="9"></form></div><a href="" class="button phonePopupwhite" id="phoneSignup" title="Sign up">Sign up - for free</a><div class="terms"><p>By clicking "Sign up free" I agree to Baobab Circles <a href="http://baobabcircle.com/terms.html">Terms of service</a>.</p></div><hr><h3>Already have an account?</h3><p>You can still access your account by entering your<br>mobile phone details above and following the<br>prompts.</p></div><script src="scripts/vendor.js"></script><script src="scripts/main.js"></script></body></html>
